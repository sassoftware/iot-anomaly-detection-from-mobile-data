# IoT-Demo-Client 

IoT client for phone based demos.  This app will collect data from the various sensors and forward them to the SAS IoT platform (ESP).  
This app will be able to support various demo types based on the demo scenario.  
For example, the phone might be used as a vibration sensor or perhaps a visual recognition client. 
Built using Corona SDK. 

This app uses OOP and provides a good example of how to use OOP with Lua and external modules.  


## Getting Started

Simply download this repository and run it using the Corona SDK. (Start with main.lua)

## Changing Themes

All of the data for this application comes from a file called demodefinitions.lua.  To change the look and feel of this applicaiton to fit your interests
simply change the data to suit your needs.  Changing theme colors is also possible via the theme vaiables.  
The intent is to make this more of a demo platform than a one demo client.  As such each type of demo will be defined in the demodefinitions.lua file.  
New demos will be then added to the nav menu which is displayed when the hamburger is pressed.
